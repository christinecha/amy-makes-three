          Carla and Greg Forrest have the perfect married life. Attractive, well-off, and loving in their relationship, they are happily preparing for the birth of their first child. However, tragedy strikes - they lose their baby Amy, after she's born prematurely. Although both are shocked by the death, Greg tries to move forward with their lives as a couple. But Carla cannot, and in her grief welcomes a delusion that Amy is still alive in their house.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Carla is right about that.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Amy Forrest, now 9 years old, is most definitely in the house - a demanding, troubled young ghost that threatens to haunt Carla and Greg until they join her on the other side.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          In the spirits of The Shining, The Others and Black Swan - AMY MAKES THREE is a taut, electrifying thriller; that uses both psychological and supernatural dimensions to tell a powerful story about loss, spirit, and catharsis.
